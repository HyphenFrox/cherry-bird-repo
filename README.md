# Cherry Bird Repo

Cherry Bird Repo is a wildlife oberservation repository that displays all the wildlife observered in the world by nature enthusiasts.

# Fetures of the app:

- Powerfull filter features let you filter by Taxonomy, Rank, Location, Threatened etc.
- Proximity feature lets you find observations made around your location.
- I am trying to add more to this list.

Under the hood this app uses [React](http://reactjs.org/), [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [iNaturalist's public API](http://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/) to fetch and display all the wildlife oberservations recorded by [iNaturalist](http://inaturalist.org/).

If you have any suggestions or problems with the app. You can contact me here on [Github](http://github.com/HyphenFrox), [Twitter](http://twiter.com/HyphenFrox) or on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/hyphenfrox/).
