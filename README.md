# Cherry Bird Repo

Cherry Bird Repo is a wildlife observation repository that displays all the wildlife observed in the world by nature enthusiasts.

# Fetures of the app:

- filter features let you filter by Taxonomy, Rank, Location, Threatened, etc.
- I am trying to add more to this list.

# How does it work?

Under the hood, this app uses [React](http://reactjs.org/), [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) and, [iNaturalist's public API](http://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/) to fetch and display all the wildlife observations recorded and uploaded by the users of [iNaturalist](http://inaturalist.org/).

# Goals in development

- To add a proximity feature that lets you view observations made around you.
- To make the UI design of the app more unique that is not just generic Material UI design.

If you have any suggestions or problems with the app. You can contact me here on [Github](http://github.com/HyphenFrox), [Twitter](http://twiter.com/HyphenFrox) or on [LinkedIn](http:/linkedin.com/in/hyphenfrox/).
