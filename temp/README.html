<h1>Cherry Bird Repo</h1>

<p>
  Cherry Bird Repo is a wildlife observation repository that displays all the
  wildlife observed in the world by nature enthusiasts.
</p>

<h1>Fetures of the app:</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    filter features let you filter by Taxonomy, Rank, Location, Threatened, etc.
  </li>
  <li>I am trying to add more to this list.</li>
</ul>

<h1>How does it work?</h1>

<p>
  Under the hood, this app uses <a href="http://reactjs.org/">React</a>,
  <a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material UI</a> and,
  <a href="http://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/">iNaturalist&#39;s public API</a>
  to fetch and display all the wildlife observations recorded and uploaded by
  the users of <a href="http://inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>.
</p>

<h1>Goals in development</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    To add a proximity feature that lets you view observations made around you.
  </li>
  <li>
    To make the UI design of the app more unique that is not just generic
    Material UI design.
  </li>
</ul>
